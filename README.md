### Pre-Requisite / Python learning Resources

- [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)
- If new to Python - https://github.com/sushgandhi/Python-Lectures
- Another greate Python Learning Resource - https://automatetheboringstuff.com/

### Best Code First Course for developers 

- Practical Deep Learning - from 0 to advanced [Fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/)
- Doesn't get into math and stats, for that refer the rest of the courses
